    <h1><font color="#007366">A modern learning hub</font></h1>

    KRC is a multi-storeyed, fully air-conditioned facility that blends traditional and digital learning resources. It houses an extensive collection of textbooks, reference books, scientific and technical journals, and standards in both print and digital formats. Constantly evolving to meet user needs, KRC integrates modern technology with conventional library services to support academic and research activities effectively.<br><br>

    Inspired by Dr S R Ranganathan, the Father of Library Science, KRC embodies the essence of a library as a trinity of learning resources, faculty, students, and library staff. Patrons visit to access, read, consult, and borrow print materials, while its vast collection of e-resources enables remote access for enhanced learning.<br><br>

    KRC is structured into multiple specialised sections, including acquisition, technical processing, circulation, and textbooks for diverse disciplines such as management, engineering, science, and humanities. Additionally, it houses a digital library, a periodical and magazine section, and dedicated facilities for physically disabled and visually challenged users, equipped with assistive technologies.<br><br>

    KRC is a fully automated library that leverages KOHA open-source software for seamless operations. A digital repository powered by E-Print software further enhances access to scholarly resources.
